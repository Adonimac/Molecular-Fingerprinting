Molecular Fingerprinting

Project Overview
In this assignment, molecular fingerprinting techniques are used to compare a set of statins (Pravastatin, Atorvastatin, Fluvastatin, and Simvastatin). Often prescribed drugs that lower cholesterol and lower the risk of heart disease are called statins. The project's objective is to determine the statins' pairwise similarity based on the chemical structures provided by SMILES strings. In order to create molecular fingerprints for every statin, calculate similarity scores, and store these scores in a similarity matrix, the analysis makes use of the RDKit cheminformatics toolkit. This assignment sheds light on the structural similarities between theseÂ widely prescribed drugs.

Instructions for Running the Project

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Setting Up the Environment
Clone the Repository or Download the Files:

Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.
Open Google Colaboratory:

Open Google Colaboratory in your web browser.

Upload the ipynb file:
Upload the ipynb file (Assignment5Chemistry.ipynb) to your Google Collab session.

2. Running the Code

Before running the notebook, ensure that you have the following Python packages installed:
!pip install rdkit

Run the Notebook:

Run each cell in the notebook sequentially. 

Analyze the Results:

Review the similarities to assess the structural similarities between the statins. The comparison is a quantitative measure of how similar each pair of statins is based on their molecular structures.

Dependencies
The project uses the following Python libraries:

rdkit
pandas


These libraries are available in Google Colaboratory by default. If you are running the notebook on a different platform, ensure these dependencies are installed. You can install them using the following commands:

!pip install rdkit 
!pip install pandas

Conclusion

This assignment demonstrates the use of RDKit for generating molecular fingerprints and computing structural similarities between statins. By following the instructions above, you can replicate the analysis, explore the structural relationships between different statins, and gain insights into the chemical properties that may influence their pharmacological effects.
